 * The controls are as follows: <BR>
 *      <emsp>Left Stick for pan motion (gamepad1.left_stick_x and gamepad1.left_stick_y) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Right Stick for turn motion (only uses the x direction : gamepad1.right_stick_y) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Right Bumper for Launching Ring (gamepad1.right_bumper) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Left Bumper for Grip Arm Servos (gamepad1.left_bumper) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Right Trigger for Accelerating robot (gamepad1.right_trigger) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Button A to Powershot selection (gamepad1.a) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Button Y to High Goal selection (gamepad1.y) <BR>
 *      <emsp>Button X to Turn delta left (gamepad1.x) <BR>
